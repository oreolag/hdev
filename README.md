  Hyperion Development
</h1> 

Based on [ETH Zurich Systems Group hdev,](https://github.com/fpgasystems/hdev) **Hyperion Development** is a CLI featuring a **dynamic resource manager** that adapts to the underlying hardware, enabling infrastructure setup, validation, and application deployment through an intuitive **device index.** 

Moreover, it offers a collection of carefully curated **templates** based on open-source frameworks, providing **pre-configured projects** that enable developers to quickly address a broader range of acceleration problems and challenges efficiently.
